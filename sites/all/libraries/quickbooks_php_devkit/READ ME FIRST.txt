 QuickBooks integration support for PHP 5.x+ 
 
 The package you've downloaded contains code and documentation for connecting 
 various versions and editions of QuickBooks to PHP, allowing your PHP 
 applications to do fancy things like:
 
  - Automatically send orders placed on your website to QuickBooks 
  
  - Charge credit cards using the QuickBooks Merchant Service
  
  - Connect to Intuit Anywhere / the Intuit Partner Platform and access IDS Services  
  
  - Get access to QuickBooks reports 
  
  - Pull information out of QuickBooks and display it online 
  
  - Connect to all Microsoft Windows versions of QuickBooks
  
  - Connect to QuickBooks Online Edition
  
  - etc. etc. etc.
  
  
 Almost anything you can do in the QuickBooks GUI, in QuickBooks Online 
 Edition, and with QuickBooks Merchant Service can be accomplished via this 
 framework. 

    If you have questions, suggestions, or find a bug, the absolute best way to
